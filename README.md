## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

FastFit is in a nutshell a fasting tracker and a calorie counter. It helps you keep track of your fasting hours and your daily calorie intake.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This project uses the [GOTTH Stack](https://github.com/arejula27/goth-stack), which is:
- [Go Lang](https://golang.org/) as the backend
- [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) as the web framework
- [Templ](https://templ.guide/) as the template engine
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for staying with tailwindUI
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for the frontend magic

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
